# Theme - @axiscommunications/fluent-illustrations

Axis branded illustrations

# WORK IN PROGRESS

Currently you are free too copy svg directly from ./assets to use in your projects.
We plan to expose illustrations similar to icons in future, as react components.

## Assets

The `assets` folder contains all the SVG icons.
There is only one icon per folder. However, it should exist in a dark and light version.
The naming convention is `My Custom Illustration\il_axis_my_custom_illustration_type.svg` where type is either `light` or `dark`.
