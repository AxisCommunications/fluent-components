# Illustrations - @axiscommunications/fluent-illustrations

Axis branded illustrations

## Usage
You can use svg illustration directly from the `assets` folder

Your can consume illustrations as `React Functional Components`
  * The components are `<img/>` and can take props accordingly
  * React components use width: auto by default

example:
```tsx
import React from "react";
import { AddUserDark, AddUserLight } from "@axiscommunications/fluent-illustrations";


function IllustrationReactExample(){

  return(
    <div>
      <AddUserDark />
      <AddUserLight width={100}/>
    </div>
    )
}
;
```
## Assets

The `assets` folder contains all the SVG icons.
There is only one illustration per folder. However, it should exist in a dark and light version.
The naming convention is `My Custom Illustration\il_axis_my_custom_illustration_type.svg` where type is either `light` or `dark`.

## Add/update or remove illustrations

### Step 1 - adjust illustrations
#### Add
Create a new folder in `assets` folder. Add a dark and light svg following the convention above. We recommend that your svg:s are optimized. They will be optimized before transformed to react components.
#### or/and Update
Identify the `assets` folder containing the illustration you want to update. You can update folder name and/or svg name and content freely.
#### or/and Remove
Identify the `assets` folder containing the illustrations you want to remove. Delete folder.

### Step 2 - generate react components
Run script target `illustrations:deploy`.
This script will start a chain of operations to generate react components. In short it will:
* Run 3rd part svg optimizer on svgs
* Wrap svg in react component (and image, src=svg)
* Package index file for export

The components will be divided into chunk-files in the `illustrations` folder.

**known issue** when doing a lot of updates, we recommend to empty this folder completely before running script. currently it only override files, not remove. 

For example: if there are lots of illustrations divided into 3 chunk-files. Then you remove a lot of them, now it generates 2 chunk-files. the 3rd will linger, delete it! :D

### Step 3 - verify illustrations
When done please start the dev example project and navigate to illustration page.
verify that all look good!

Now you can create a PR of your changes!
